Page Object Model
The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that allows for better test maintenance and reduces code duplication. A page object is created for each page of the application, and it encapsulates the page's locators and functions. By following the POM pattern, any changes in the UI can be easily managed in the page object, without having to change the test logic or step definitions.
